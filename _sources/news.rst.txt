=============
Release Notes
=============

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.7 (2020-07-05)
---------------------------

- Avoid trying to match old packages against current repo for git support (#215).

- Rename DeprecatedPkg result keyword to DeprecatedDep and try to disambiguate its output
  message (#218).

- FormatReporter: Use an empty string for unmatched variables (#211) and add the result output
  name to the available attributes.

- DroppedKeywordsCheck: Disregard non-VCS pkgs without KEYWORDS (#224).

- Ignore license and keyword settings from system config for StableRequest results (#229).

- pkgcheck scan: Support output name arguments for -k/--keywords (#221). 

- StableArchesAddon: Use known stable arches from arches.desc (GLEP 72) if available (#230).

- pkgcheck scan: Fully support custom user config files via --config.

- ProfilesAddon: Automatically enable experimental profiles for selected arches that only have
  experimental profiles (#222) and selected keywords that require them (#225).

- VisibilityCheck: Sort failed package atoms for NonsolvableDep results (#223).

- Filter package atoms from path list when scanning git commits (#217).

- Use a ``git stash`` context manager when scanning commits so untracked files or uncommitted
  changes are ignored.

- Only add eclass directory when scanning git commits if it exists in the target repo (#231).

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.6 (2020-02-09)
---------------------------

- VariableInHomepage: Include parameter expansion chars in flagged variable and
  drop flagging for unbracketed variables until bash parsing support exists.

- Drop PythonSingleUseMismatch result since python-single-r1.eclass will no
  longer generate PYTHON_TARGETS.

- FetchablesUrlCheck: Disable package feed filtering so all defined SRC_URI
  URLs are scanned by default.

- Output create/update git repo cache message to stderr by default to help tell
  the user what's happening during possibly long scan delays.

- Add config file support at /etc/pkgcheck/pkgcheck.conf,
  ~/.config/pkgcheck/pkgcheck.conf, and metadata/pkgcheck.conf for system-wide,
  user, and repo-specific default settings respectively. Any settings found in
  those config files will be overridden by matching command line arguments.
  Almost all command line arguments can be set in config files, see the man
  page or online docs for config examples.

- For network checks, add fallback to GET requests if HEAD requests fail with
  501 or 405 HTTP errors (#208).

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.5 (2020-01-26)
---------------------------

- RedundantLongDescription: Flag redundant longdescription metadata.xml
  elements (#205).

- RedundantDodir: Flag redundant dodir usage (#169).

- pkgcheck scan: Add special argument 'net' for -c/--checks option that enables
  all network checks. This allows for easily running all network checks using
  something similar to ``pkgcheck scan --net -c net``.

- AbsoluteSymlink: Flag dosym calls using paths starting with ${EPREFIX}.

- DeprecatedInsinto: Flag deprecated insinto usage with unnecessary quote usage.

- pkgcheck scan: Show a traceback and forcibly exit on unexpected exceptions
  when running checks.

- EclassBashSyntaxError: Report bash syntax errors in eclasses.

- pkgcheck scan: Allow location specific scopes to override target path
  restrict scope. This makes scanning against a file path target like
  ${REPO_PATH}/eclass only enable eclass checks instead of doing a full repo
  scan.

- pkgcheck scan: Allow path target args of '.' or '..' to work as expected.

- RdependChange: Flag non-live, locally committed packages with altered RDEPEND
  lacking revbumps.

- ``pkgcheck scan --commits`` now enables eclass checks if it notices any
  relevant eclass changes in the local repo.

- EclassHeaderCheck: Add initial eclass header checks similar to the ones done
  against ebuilds in the gentoo repo.

- pkgcheck scan: Drop the -C/--checkset option, it might return in some form
  once reworked config file support is done.

- MetadataUrlCheck: Add initial check for metadata.xml URL validity (#167).

- Ignore unstaged changes when generating targets for ``pkgcheck scan
  --commits``.

- RedundantUriRename: Flag redundant SRC_URI renames (#196).

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.4 (2020-01-11)
---------------------------

- BinaryFile: Ignore some classes of false positives that use multiple
  encodings.

- Output repo and commit related results after any package related results
  found during scanning if using a relevant scan scope level.

- Sort git commit-related results by name or description for multiple results
  against a single commit.

- BadCommitSummary: Convert to commit result instead of package result since it
  directly relates to the commit made more than the package itself.

- Add optional ref argument support for --commits option. This allows passing a
  commit or reference to diff the current tree against in order to determine
  scanning targets.

- GitPkgCommitsCheck: Flag all incorrect copyright dates instead of just
  outdated ones.

- GitCommitsCheck: Use a single ``git cat-file`` process for verifying all
  Fixes/Reverts tags instead of one per commit.

- InvalidCommitMessage: Check for empty lines between summary, body, and tags.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.3 (2019-12-29)
---------------------------

- Flag git tags and commit messages that don't follow specifications described
  in GLEP 66 (#186) via InvalidCommitTag and InvalidCommitMessage results.

- Skip reporting blocker dependencies marked as deprecated.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.2 (2019-12-20)
---------------------------

- pkgcheck scan: Change --filtered option to -f/--filter which supports both
  'repo' and 'latest' arguments to filter scanned packages (#184).

- Fix ``pkgcheck scan --commits`` usage with overlays (#188).

- MissingUseDepDefault: Check unconditional use deps for missing defaults,
  previously only conditional flags were being checked.

- DuplicateEclassInherits: Add initial result for flagging duplicate eclass
  inherits.

- BadWhitespaceCharacter: Add initial result for flagging unicode whitespace in
  ebuilds that bash doesn't treat as regular whitespace.

- ProfilesCheck: Add support for validating package.deprecated entries.

- Use .git/info/exclude from repos in addition to .gitignore to ignore files
  for relevant checks.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.1 (2019-11-30)
---------------------------

- DeprecatedPkg: Add initial result for flagging package dependencies
  deprecated via package.deprecated.

- DeprecatedEclassCheck: Add support for conditionally deprecating eclasses
  with epatch and versionator being the first eclasses to be flagged for
  conditional deprecation.

- SourcingCheck: Add separate check to validate ebuild sourcing and flag
  invalid SLOTs via a new InvalidSlot result.

- pkgcheck scan: Add --sorted option to forcibly perform a global sort -- only
  useful for limited cases such as generating expected test output.

- pkgcheck cache: Add support for listing and removing cache types for
  non-registered repos.

- pkgcheck scan: Replace --git-disable/--profile-cache options with --cache. By
  default all caches are enabled. To disable all of them, use something similar
  to '--cache false'.

  Cache types can also be enabled or disabled individually using a
  comma-separated cache type list, e.g. '--cache profiles' will only enable
  profiles caches and '--cache=-git' will only disable git caches leaving
  all other caches enabled.

- Prioritize checks that scan for metadata errors so they get run before checks
  that use the related metadata attrs.

- Fix memory leak when generating caches for certain git repos (#178).

- pkgcheck scan: Drop --profiles-base option.

- Avoid caching a repo's base package.mask for profile filters in order to
  avoid more cases of profile cache invalidation.

- Split InvalidDependency into individual attr results, e.g. InvalidRdepend.

- Split RestrictsCheck into separate checks for RESTRICT and PROPERTIES.

- AbsoluteSymlinkCheck: Report dosym usage with path variables, e.g. ${ED}.

- BadHomepage: Flag packages using a generic Gentoo HOMEPAGE (#177).

- Add initial support for using a repo's .gitignore file to avoid reporting
  matching files for certain results (#140).

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.7.0 (2019-11-08)
---------------------------

- BadInsIntoCheck: Skip reporting insinto calls using subdirs since the related
  commands don't support installing files into subdirs.

- PerlCheck: Run by default if perl and deps are installed otherwise skip unless
  explicitly enabled.

- SourcingError: Add specific result for ebuilds that fail sourcing due to
  metadata issues.

- Fix git --commits option restriction.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.9 (2019-11-04)
---------------------------

- MissingSlash: Avoid some types of false positives where the path variable is
  used to create a simple string, but not as a path directly.

- BadPerlModuleVersion: Add support for verifying Gentoo's perl module
  versioning scheme -- not run by default since it requires various perl
  dependencies.

- BadCommitSummary: Also allow "${CATEGORY}/${P}:" prefixes.

- MetadataError: Fix suppressing duplicate results due to multiprocess usage.

- VisibleVcsPkg: Collapse profile reports for non-verbose mode.

- Use replacement character for non-UTF8 characters while decoding author,
  committer, and message fields from git logs.

- pkgcheck scan: Try parsing target arguments as restrictions before falling
  back to using path restrictions.

- EmptyProject: Check for projects with no members in projects.xml.

- StaticSrcUri: Check if SRC_URI uses static values for P or PV instead of the
  dynamic, variable equivalents.

- MatchingChksums: Check for distfiles that share the same checksums but have
  different names.

- pkgcheck scan: Parallelize checks for targets passed in via cli args.

- Sort versioned package results under package scanning scope so outputted
  results are deterministic when scanning against single packages similar to
  what the output is per package when running scans at a category or repo
  level.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.8 (2019-10-06)
---------------------------

- pkgcheck scan: Add -t/--tasks option to limit the number of async tasks that
  can run concurrently. Currently used to limit the number of concurrent
  network requests made.

- Repository level checks are now run in parallel by default.

- Fix iterating over git commits to fix git-related checks.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.7 (2019-10-05)
---------------------------

- pkgcheck scan: All scanning scopes now run checks in parallel by default for
  multi-core systems. For repo/category scope levels parallelism is done per
  package while for package/version scope levels parallelism is done per
  version. The -j/--jobs option was also added to allow controlling the amount
  of processes used when scanning, by default it's set to the number of CPUs
  the target system has.

- pkgcheck cache: Add initial cache subcommand to support updating/removing
  caches used by pkgcheck. This allows users to forcibly update/remove caches
  when they want instead of pkgcheck only handling the process internally
  during the scanning process.

- Add specific result keywords for metadata issues relating to various package
  attributes instead of using the generic MetadataError for all of them.

- Drop check for PortageInternals as the last usage was dropped from the tree.

- Add EmptyCategoryDir and EmptyPackageDir results to warn when the gentoo repo
  has empty category or package directories that people removing packages
  forgot to handle.

- Drop HttpsAvailableCheck and its related HttpsAvailable result. The network
  checks should now support dynamically pinging sites to test for viability.

- Port network checks to use the requests module for http/https requests so
  urllib is only used for ftp URLs.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.6 (2019-09-24)
---------------------------

- HttpsUrlAvailable: Check http URLs for https availability (not run by
  default).

- MissingLicenseRestricts: Skip RESTRICT="mirror" for packages lacking SRC_URI.

- DeprecatedEapiCommand: Check for deprecated EAPI commands (e.g. dohtml usage in EAPI 6).

- BannedEapiCommand: Check for banned EAPI commands (e.g. dohtml usage in EAPI 7).

- StableRequestCheck: Use ebuild modification events instead of added events to
  check for stabilization.

- Add support for filtering versioned results to only check the latest VCS and
  non-VCS packages per slot.

- MissingSlotDep: Fix dep slot determination by using use flag stripped dep
  atoms instead of unversioned atoms.

- Add HomepageUrlCheck and FetchablesUrlCheck network-based checks that check
  HOMEPAGE and SRC_URI urls for various issues and require network access so
  they aren't run by default. The ``--net`` option must be specified in order
  to run them.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.5 (2019-09-18)
---------------------------

- InvalidUseFlags: Flag invalid USE flags in IUSE.

- UnknownUseFlags: Use specific keyword result for unknown USE flags in IUSE
  instead of MetadataError.

- pkgcheck scan: Add ``info`` alias for -k/--keywords option and rename
  errors/warnings aliases to ``error`` and ``warning``.

- Add Info result type and mark a several non-warning results as info level
  (e.g. RedundantVersion and PotentialStable).

- MissingLicenseRestricts: Flag restrictive license usage missing required
  RESTRICT settings.

- MissingSlotDepCheck: Properly report missing slotdeps for atom with use deps.

- pkgcheck scan: Add ``all`` alias for -c/--checks option.

- MissingSignOff: Add initial check for missing commit message sign offs.

- InvalidLicenseHeader: Add initial license header check for the gentoo repo.

- BadCommitSummary: Add initial commit message summary formatting check.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.4 (2019-09-13)
---------------------------

- Add FormatReporter supporting custom format string output.

- pkgcheck scan: Drop --metadata-xsd-required option since the related file is
  now bundled with pkgcore.

- Add CsvReporter for outputting results in CSV format.

- pkgcheck scan: Add --commits option that use local git repo changes to
  determine scan targets.

- DroppedUnstableKeywords: Disregard when stable target keywords exist.

- LocalUSECheck: Add test for USE flags with reserved underscore character.

- PathVariablesCheck: Drop 'into' from prefixed dir functions list to avoid
  false positives in comments.

- MissingUnpackerDepCheck: Drop checks for jar files since most are being
  directly installed and not unpacked.

- Make gentoo repo checks work for external gentoo repos on systems with a
  configured gentoo system repo.

- UnknownFile: Flag unknown files in package directories for the gentoo repo.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.3 (2019-08-30)
---------------------------

- PathVariablesCheck: Flag double path prefix usage on uncommented lines only
  to avoid some types of false positives.

- BadInsIntoCheck: flag ``insinto /usr/share/doc/${PF}`` usage for recent EAPIs
  as it should be replaced by docinto and dodoc [-r] calls.

- BadInsIntoCheck: Drop old cron support.

- Skip global checks when running at cat/pkg/version restriction levels for
  ``pkgcheck scan``. Also, skip package level checks that require package set
  context when running at a single version restriction level.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.2 (2019-08-26)
---------------------------

- TreeVulnerabilitiesCheck: Restrict to checking against the gentoo repo only.

- Allow explicitly selected keywords to properly enable their related checks if
  they must be explicitly enabled.

- UnusedMirrorsCheck: Ignore missing checksums for fetchables that will be
  caught by other checks.

- pkgcheck replay: Add support for replaying JsonStream reporter files.

- Add initial JsonStream reporter as an alternative to the pickle reporters for
  serializing and deserializing result objects.

- Add support for comparing and hashing result objects.

- Fix triggering metadata.xml maintainer checks only for packages.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.1 (2019-08-25)
---------------------------

- NonexistentProfilePath: Change from warning to an error.

- Fix various XML result initialization due to missing attributes.

- MissingUnpackerDepCheck: Fix matching against versioned unpacker deps.

- Rename BadProto keyword to BadProtocol.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.6.0 (2019-08-23)
---------------------------

- Profile data is now cached on a per repo basis in ~/.cache/pkgcore/pkgcheck
  (or wherever the related XDG cache environment variables point) to speed up
  singular package scans. These caches are checked and verified for staleness
  on each run and are enabled by default.

  To forcibly disable profile caches include ``--profile-cache n`` or similar
  as arguments to ``pkgcheck scan``.

- When running against a git repo, the historical package removals and
  additions are scanned from ``git log`` and used to populate virtual repos
  that enable proper stable request checks and nonexistent/outdated blocker
  checks. Note that initial runs where these repos are being built from scratch
  can take a minute or more depending on the system; however, subsequent runs
  shouldn't take much time to update the cached repos.

  To disable git support entirely include ``--git-disable y`` or similar as
  arguments to ``pkgcheck scan``.

- zshcomp: Add initial support for keyword, check, and reporter completion.

- Enhance support for running against unconfigured, external repos. Now
  ``pkgcheck scan`` should be able to handle scanning against relevant paths to
  unknown repos passed to it or against a repo with no arguments passed that
  the current working directory is currently within.

  UnknownProfileUse checks that scan various files in a repo's profiles
  directory looking for old packages and/or USE flags.

  'replay', and 'show' subcommands with 'scan' still being the default
  subcommand so previous commandline usage for running pkgcheck remains the
  same for now.

- Add 'errors' and 'warnings' aliases for the -k/--keywords option, e.g. if you
  only want to scan for errors use the following: pkgcheck -k errors

  specified as a profile in profiles.desc or aren't sourced by any as a parent.

- Add python3.6 support and drop python3.3 support.

- Add UnnecessaryManifest report for showing unnecessary manifest entries for
  non-DIST targets on a repo with thin manifests enabled.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.5.3 (2016-05-29)
---------------------------

* Fix new installs using pip.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.5.2 (2016-05-28)
---------------------------

* Replace libxml2 with lxml-based validator for glep68 schema validation.

* UseAddon: Use profile-derived implicit USE flag lists instead of pre-EAPI 5
  hacks. This also improves the unused global USE flag check to look for unused
  USE_EXPAND flags.

* Add various repo-level sanity checks for profile and arch lists.

* Output reports for ~arch VCS ebuilds as well, previously only vcs ebuilds
  with stable keywords would display warnings.

* Large reworking of profile and arch addon options. In summary, the majority
  of the previous options have been replaced with -a/--arches and -p/--profiles
  that accept comma separated lists of targets to enable or disable. The
  keywords stable, dev, and exp that related to the sets of stable,
  development, and experimental profiles from the targetted repo can also be
  used as --profiles arguments.

  For example, to scan all stable profiles use the following::

    pkgcheck -p stable

  To scan all profiles except experimental profiles (note the required use of
  an equals sign when starting the argument list with a disabled target)::

    pkgcheck -p=-exp

  See the related man page sections for more details.

* Officially support python3 (3.3 and up).

* Add initial man page generated from argparse info.

* Migrate from optparse to argparse, usability-wise there shouldn't be any
  changes.

* Drop ChangeLog file checks, the gentoo repo moved to git so ChangeLogs are
  not in the repo anymore.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.5.1 (2015-08-10)
---------------------------

* Remove portdir references, if you use a custom config file you may need to
  update 'portdir' references to use 'gentoo' instead or whatever your main
  repo is.

---------------------------
pkgcheck 0.5.0 (2015-04-01)
---------------------------

* Suppress possible memory exhaustion cases for visibility checks due to
  transitive use flag dependencies.

* Project, python module, and related scripts renamed from pkgcore-checks (or
  in the case of the python module pkgcore_checks) to pkgcheck.

* Add --profile-disable-exp option to skip experimental profiles.

* Make the SizeViolation check test individual files in $FILESDIR, not the
  entire $FILESDIR itself.

* Make UnusedLocalFlags scan metadata.xml for local use flags instead of the
  deprecated repo-wide use.local.desc file.

* Stable arch related checks (e.g. UnstableOnly) now default to using only the
  set of stable arches defined by profiles.desc.

* Add check for deprecated EAPIs.

* Conflicting manifests chksums scanning was added.

* Removed hardcoded manifest hashes list, use layout.conf defined list of
  required hashes (didn't exist till ~5 years after the check was written).

* Update pkgcore API usage to move away from deprecated functionality.

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.15 (2011-10-27)
----------------------------------

* pkgcore-checks issue #2; if metadata.dtd is required but can't be fetched,
  suppress metadata_xml check.  If the check must be ran (thus unfetchable
  metadata.dtd should be a failure), pass --metadata-dtd-required.

* pkgcore-checks now requires pkgcore 0.7.3.

* fix racey test failure in test_addons due to ProfileNode instance caching.

* fix exception in pkg directory checks for when files directory
  doesn't exist.

* cleanup of deprecated api usage.

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.14 (2011-04-24)
----------------------------------

* Updated compatibility w/ recent snakeoil/pkgcore changes.

* deprecated eclasses list was updated.

* LICENSE checks for virtual/* are now suppressed.

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.13 (2010-01-08)
----------------------------------

* fix to use dep scanning in visibility where it was missing use deps that
  can never be satisfied for a specific profile due to use masking/forcing.

* more visibility optimizations; Grand total in combination w/ optimziations
  leveled in snakeoil/pkgcore since pkgcore-checks 0.4.12 released, 58%
  faster now.

* ignore unstated 'prefix' flag in conditionals- much like bootstrap, its'
  the latest unstated.

* added a null reporter for performance testing.

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.12 (2009-12-27)
----------------------------------

* corner case import error in metadata_xml scan for py3k is now fixed; if
  you saw urllib.urlopen complaints, this is fixed.

* >snakeoil-0.3.4 is now required for sdist generation.

* visibility scans now use 22% less memory (around 130MB on python2.6 x86_64)
  and is about 3% faster.

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.11 (2009-12-20)
----------------------------------

* minor speedup in visibility scans- about 3% faster now.

* fix a traceback in deprecated from when portage writes the ebuild cache out
  w/out any _eclasses_ entry.

* fix a rare traceback in visibility scans where a virtual metapkg has zero
  matches.

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.10 (2009-12-14)
----------------------------------

* fix a bug where use deps on metapkgs was invalidly being flagged.

---------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.9 (2009-11-26)
---------------------------------

* fix a bug in test running- bzr_verinfo isn't generated for pkgcore-checks
  in sdist (no need), yet build_py was trying to regenerate it.  Basically
  broke installation on machines that lacked bzr.

---------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.8 (2009-11-26)
---------------------------------

* experimental py3k support.

* test runner improvements via depending on snakeoil.distutils_extensions.

---------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.7 (2009-10-26)
---------------------------------

* fix invalid flagging of use deps on PyQt4 for ia64; basically PyQt4[webkit]
  is valid due to a pkg level masked use reversal... the checking code however
  wasn't doing incremental expansion itself..  Same could occur for forced use.

---------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.6 (2009-10-22)
---------------------------------

* fix a bug in tristate use evaluation of potential USE combinations.
  Roughly, if a flag is masked *and* forced, the result is it's masked.

* compatibility fixes for pkgcore 0.5; 0.5 isn't required, but advised.

---------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.5 (2008-11-07)
---------------------------------

* verify whether or not a requested use state is actually viable when profile
  masking/forcing is taken into account.

---------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.4 (2008-10-21)
---------------------------------

* EAPI2 support for checking use/transitive use deps.

* ticket 216; basically portage doesn't always write out _eclasses_ entries
  in the cache- if they're empty, it won't.  pkgcore-checks visibility vcs
  eclass tests assumed otherwise- this is now fixed.

* pcheck now only outputs the number of tests it's running if --debug is
  enabled.

---------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.3 (2008-03-18)
---------------------------------

* ticket 8; false positive unused global USE flags due to not stripping '+-'
  from iuse defaults.

* ticket 7: tune down metadata xml checks verbosity.

* dropped ModularXPortingReport; no longer needed.

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.2 (2007-12-15)
----------------------------------

* minor release to be EAPI=1 compatible wrt IUSE defaults

----------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4.1 (2007-07-16)
----------------------------------

* fixed ticket 90; NonExistantDeps occasionally wouldn't report later versions
  of an offender.

* --disable-arches option; way to specifically disable an arch (blacklisting)
  instead of having to specify all arches.

-------------------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.4 (2007-06-06)
-------------------------------

* update to use snakeoil api.

* Add check to metadata_check.DependencyReport for self-blocking atoms; for
  example, if dev-util/diffball RDEPEND has !dev-util/diffball.

* ticket 82; Fix BadProto result object so it has proper threshold.

* Fix class serialization bug in RestrictsReport.

* profile loadup optimization; pkgcore weakly caches the intermediate nodes,
  pcheck's profile loadup however specifically released the profiles every
  looping; now it temporarily holds onto it, thus allowing the caching to kick
  in.  Among other things, cuts file reads down from 1800 to around around 146.

--------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.3.5
--------------------

* addition of __attrs__ to base.Result classes; use this if __slots__ doesn't
  suffice for listing the attrs to pickle.

* Thanks to Michael Sterret for pointing it out; tweak cleanup scan so that it
  notes 1.12 overshadows 1.11 (stable keywords overshadow earlier unstable
  versions): for example-
  1.11: ~x86 ~amd64
  1.12: x86 ~amd64

--------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.3.4
--------------------

* treat pkg.restrict as a depset.

--------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.3.3
--------------------

* drop digest specific checks; portage now prunes digests on sync regardless
  of whether or not the repo is m2 pure; thus, no way to detect if a missing
  digest is actually a screwup in the repo, or if it's portage being 'special'.
  May re-add the checks down the line, currently however removing them for
  the common case.

* back down check for files directory if manifest2; manifest2 glep didn't
  specify that files directory could be dropped, but portage has deviated there.
  Since been backed down, but getting ahead so we don't need an intermediate
  release when they try it again.

* added check for missing metadata.xml; refactored common error class selection
  logic into base class.

--------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.3.2
--------------------

* correct tracebacks when dealing with a few result objects from repo_metadata

--------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.3.1
--------------------

* makes StaleUnstable abide by --arches; ticket 59 (thanks leio).
* stop complaining about empty keywords, since they're now allowed instead of
  using -\*.

------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.3
------------------

* heavy refactoring of reporter subsystem, and clean up of check results.
  Better messages, better output for normal usage.  to_xml() methods were
  dropped (XmlReporter handles it on it's own), same for to_str() in favor
  of short_desc and long_desc attributes.
* whitespace checks now output one result for each classification for an
  ebuild, instead of emitting reports for each line.
* all remaining 'info' statements are pushed to stderr now.
* new PickleStream reporter; used to serialize check results, and flush the
  stream out stdout.  If you need to get at the data generated, this is the
  sanest way to do it (alternatives require trying to deserialize what a
  reporter does, thus losing data).
* added new tool replay-pcheck-stream; used to replay a pickle stream through
  alternative reporters.

------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.2
------------------

* invocation args have changed- please see readme for details of how to
  use pcheck.
* test suite added; not yet complete coverage, but 90% of the way there.
* --list-checks output format is fair bit more human-readable now.
* better support for overlays (should work fine with appropriate commandline
  options supplied)
* optimizations, and performance regression fixes; fair bit faster then .1.
* new checks can be added via pkgcore 0.2 plugins cache.
* UI improvements; color, and human readable output.
* --xml option was dropped, use --reporter to specify the desired reporter,
  and --list-reporters to see what reporters are available
* added --enable, --disable options to prune add/remove specific checks from
  the run.
* add config based 'suites' that can be ran; basically, sets of tests/targets
  to run via pcheck.  See README for details.
* whitespace checks.

------------------
pkgcore-checks 0.1
------------------

* inital release
